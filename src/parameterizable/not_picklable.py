class NotPicklableClass:
    """A mixin class that prevents objects from being pickled or unpickled.

    This class provides a mechanism to explicitly prevent instances from being
    serialized using Python's pickle module. Classes that inherit from this
    mixin will raise TypeError exceptions when pickle attempts to serialize
    or deserialize them.

    This is useful for objects that contain non-serializable resources or
    should not be persisted for security or architectural reasons.
